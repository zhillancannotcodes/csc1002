MARKING CRITERIA 
• Coding Styles – overall program structure including layout, comments, white spaces, naming 
conven on, variables, indenta on, func ons with appropriate parameters and return. 
• Program Correctness – whether or the program works 100% as per Scope.  
• User Interac on – how informa ve and accurate informa on is exchanged between your 
program and the player. 
• Readability counts – programs that are well structured and easy to follow using func ons to 
break down complex problems into smaller cleaner generalized func ons are preferred over a 
func on embracing a complex logic with many nested condi ons and branches!  In other words, 
a design with a clean architecture and high readability is the predilec on for the course 
objec ves over efficiency.  The logic in each func on should be kept simple and short, and it 
should be designed to perform a single task and be generalized with parameters as needed. 
• KISS approach – Keep It Simple and Straigh orward. 
• Balance approach – you are not required to come up with a very opmized solu on.  However, 
take a balance between readability and efficiency with good use of program constructs.
